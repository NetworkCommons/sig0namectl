# we would like to

* import key pairs from dnssec-keygen files into golang DNS key structure


* read/write arbitrary DNS RRs under ZONE using key pair authorized in ZONE

	- export public key to KEY RR in or under ZONE
		- in allows shared access
		- under creates independent HOST/ENTITY

	- manage DNS RRs for HOST/ENTITY under ZONE
		- A/AAAA, SRV, URI & LOC
