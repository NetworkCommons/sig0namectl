 The sig0namectl project allows secure decentralised delegation of DNS update rights through communicating directly with the DNS infrastructure.

# üåê Web Browser Applications

sig0namectl browser-based applications provide easy-to-use interfaces not only to browse and access local network services and resources but also to collaborate and contribute towards providing local resources and services for local communities. The applications allow collaborative publishing and updating of DNS information on local services and resources.

Users of the browser applications can:
- browse & access published community services and resources
- publish & share new services & resources they wish to provide
- collaborate in geo mapping of community resources & services
