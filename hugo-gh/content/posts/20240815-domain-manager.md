The Domain Manager app can register new domains and create new services within it.

We have an early prototype for a browser-based sig0namectl Domain manager application. The current version can register new domains as well as create new web services within any of your domains. Under Advanced options it also allows the backup and import of domain keys into the browser environment. Even though it's under heavy development, take a sneak peak at a recent snapshot of the [domain_manager](https://sig0namectl.networkcommons.org/domain_manager.html) app.
