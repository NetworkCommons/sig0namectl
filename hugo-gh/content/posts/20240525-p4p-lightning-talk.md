With all the team present in Berlin, we took the opportunity to hold an informal team meeting outside the <a href=https://wickie.invisible.college/p4p/info>P4P conference</a> held at <a href=https://offline.place>offline.place</a>, a community space in Berlin.

Afterwards Mathias Jud gave a lightning talk for the sig0namectl project.

A get-together for local first protocols, the event was well attended by distributed crypto application developers (including <a href=http://ssbc.github.io/ssb-db/>Secure Scuttlebutt</a>). Mathias' sig0namectl lightning talk generated a good amount of interest amongst the participants. Many emerging distributed systems (such as <a href=https://ipfs.tech/>IPFS</a>) choose to utilise the DNS space to publish and propagate links to resources and can benefit from sig0namectl offering a secure, distributed update mechanism.
